Her father was a <a href=\"/wiki/Punjabi_Hindu\" title=\"Punjabi Hindu\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Punjabi Hindu</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Ambala\" title=\"Ambala\">Ambala</a>.

Among the schools she attended were <a href=\"/wiki/La_Martiniere_Lucknow\" title=\"La Martiniere Lucknow\">La Martiniere Girls' School</a> in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly. In an interview published in <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daily_News_and_Analysis\" title=\"Daily News and Analysis\">Daily News and Analysis</a></i>, Chopra said that she did not mind travelling regularly and changing schools; she welcomed it as a new experience and a way to discover India's multicultural society. Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of <a href=\"/wiki/Leh\" title=\"Leh\">Leh</a>, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of <a href=\"/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir\" title=\"Jammu and Kashmir\">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. She has said, \"I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh. My brother was just born. My dad was in the army and was posted there. I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous<span> </span>... We were all army kids there. We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a <a href=\"/wiki/Stupa\" title=\"Stupa\">stupa</a> right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley. We used to race up to the top of the stupa\". She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.</p>\n\n\n<p>At the age of thirteen, Chopra moved to the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in <a href=\"/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Newton, Massachusetts\">Newton, Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Cedar_Rapids,_Iowa\" title=\"Cedar Rapids, Iowa\">Cedar Rapids, Iowa</a>, after a stop in <a href=\"/wiki/Queens,_New_York\" title=\"Queens, New York\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Queens, New York</a>, as her aunt's family also moved frequently. While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions and studied Western classical music, choral singing and <a href=\"/wiki/Kathak\" title=\"Kathak\">Kathak</a> dance. During her teenage years in the United States, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian by an <a href=\"/wiki/African-American\" title=\"African-American\" class=\"mw-redirect\">African-American</a> classmate. She has said, \"I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs<span> </span>... But I was damn hard working. Today, my legs sell 12 brands.\"</p>\n\n<p>After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Army_Public_Schools\" title=\"Indian Army Public Schools\">Army Public School</a> in Bareilly. During this period, she won the local \"May Queen\" beauty pageant, after which she was pursued by admirers, leading her family to equip their home with bars for her protection. Her mother then entered her in the <a href=\"/wiki/Femina_Miss_India\" title=\"Femina Miss India\">Femina Miss India</a> contest of 2000; she finished second, winning the Femina <a href=\"/wiki/Miss_India_World\" title=\"Miss India World\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Miss India World</a> title.

However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 <a href=\"/wiki/Tamil_cinema\" title=\"Tamil cinema\">Tamil</a> film <i><a href=\"/wiki/Thamizhan\" title=\"Thamizhan\">Thamizhan</a></i> as the love interest of the protagonist, played by <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Vijay\" title=\"Joseph Vijay\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Vijay</a>. A review published in <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hindu\" title=\"The Hindu\">The Hindu</a></i> was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, Chopra made her <a href=\"/wiki/Bollywood\" title=\"Bollywood\">Bollywood</a> film debut as the second female lead opposite <a href=\"/wiki/Sunny_Deol\" title=\"Sunny Deol\">Sunny Deol</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Preity_Zinta\" title=\"Preity Zinta\">Preity Zinta</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Anil_Sharma\" title=\"Anil Sharma\">Anil Sharma</a>'s <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Hero:_Love_Story_of_a_Spy\" title=\"The Hero: Love Story of a Spy\">The Hero: Love Story of a Spy</a></i>. Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an agent and his fight against terrorism. <i>The Hero</i> was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics. <a href=\"/wiki/Derek_Elley\" title=\"Derek Elley\">Derek Elley</a> from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Variety_(magazine)\" title=\"Variety (magazine)\">Variety</a></i> said that \"mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut.\" Later that year she appeared in <a href=\"/wiki/Raj_Kanwar\" title=\"Raj Kanwar\">Raj Kanwar</a>'s box-office success <i><a href=\"/wiki/Andaaz\" title=\"Andaaz\">Andaaz</a></i> with <a href=\"/wiki/Akshay_Kumar\" title=\"Akshay Kumar\">Akshay Kumar</a>, again sharing the female lead (this time with the debuting <a href=\"/wiki/Lara_Dutta\" title=\"Lara Dutta\">Lara Dutta</a>).

The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hindustan_Times\" title=\"Hindustan Times\">Hindustan Times</a></i> noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of <a href=\"/wiki/Sify\" title=\"Sify\">Sify</a> praised her performance and stated she had \"all the qualities to be a star.\" Her performance earned her the <a href=\"/wiki/Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Female_Debut\" title=\"Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut\">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a> (along with Dutta) and a nomination for the <a href=\"/wiki/Filmfare_Award\" title=\"Filmfare Award\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Filmfare Award</a> for <a href=\"/wiki/Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress\" title=\"Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress\">Best Supporting Actress</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Chopra's first three releases in 2004—<i><a href=\"/wiki/Plan_(film)\" title=\"Plan (film)\">Plan</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kismat_(2004_film)\" title=\"Kismat (2004 film)\">Kismat</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Asambhav\" title=\"Asambhav\">Asambhav</a></i>—performed poorly at the box-office. Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a \"glamour quotient\", in roles that were considered \"forgettable\" by film critic Joginder Tuteja. Later that year she starred with <a href=\"/wiki/Salman_Khan\" title=\"Salman Khan\">Salman Khan</a> and Akshay Kumar in <a href=\"/wiki/David_Dhawan\" title=\"David Dhawan\">David Dhawan</a>'s romantic comedy <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mujhse_Shaadi_Karogi\" title=\"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\">Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</a></i>, which became the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India and emerged as a commercial success.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and <a href=\"/wiki/Kareena_Kapoor\" title=\"Kareena Kapoor\">Kareena Kapoor</a> in Abbas-Mustan's thriller <i><a href=\"/wiki/Aitraaz\" title=\"Aitraaz\">Aitraaz</a></i>. Chopra considers her first role as an antagonist, portraying Soniya Roy, an ambitious woman who accuses her employee of sexual harassment, as the \"biggest learning experience of her career.\" The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra's performance received critical acclaim. Author Rini Bhattacharya credited her with bringing back the seductress to the silver screen. The <i>Hindustan Times</i> cited it as the film that changed her career significantly. A reviewer writing for the <a href=\"/wiki/BBC\" title=\"BBC\">BBC</a> said, \"<i>Aitraaz</i> is Priyanka Chopra's film.

Jha</a> wrote that Chopra \"with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character.\"  Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in <a href=\"/wiki/Vipul_Amrutlal_Shah\" title=\"Vipul Amrutlal Shah\">Vipul Amrutlal Shah</a>'s family drama <i><a href=\"/wiki/Waqt:_The_Race_Against_Time\" title=\"Waqt: The Race Against Time\">Waqt: The Race Against Time</a></i>, the story of a small businessman (played by <a href=\"/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan\" title=\"Amitabh Bachchan\">Amitabh Bachchan</a>) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song \"Subah Hogi\". She suffered an accident during the filming for the song \"Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi\" when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital. The film was well received by critics, and was a commercial success.</p>\n\n\n<p>She next starred opposite <a href=\"/wiki/Arjun_Rampal\" title=\"Arjun Rampal\">Arjun Rampal</a> in the romantic mystery thriller <i><a href=\"/wiki/Yakeen_(2005_film)\" title=\"Yakeen (2005 film)\">Yakeen</a></i>, portraying the role of a possessive lover.
