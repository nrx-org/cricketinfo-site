The total project cost may be up to <span class=\"nowrap\"><span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">₹</span>454 crore</span><span> (US$63</span><span> </span><span>million)</span>. The satellite costs <span class=\"nowrap\"><span style=\"white-space: nowrap\">₹</span>153 crore</span><span> (US$21</span><span> </span><span>million)</span> and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.</p>\n\n<p>The space agency had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November following the delay in ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the <a href=\"/wiki/Pacific_Ocean\" title=\"Pacific Ocean\">Pacific Ocean</a>.

ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Polar_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle\" title=\"Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle\">Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle</a> (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the <a href=\"/wiki/Oberth_effect\" title=\"Oberth effect\">Oberth effect</a>) to place itself on a <a href=\"/wiki/Trans-Mars_injection\" title=\"Trans-Mars injection\" class=\"mw-redirect\">trans-Mars trajectory</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On 19 October 2013, ISRO chairman <a href=\"/wiki/K._Radhakrishnan\" title=\"K.

The first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results, while the fourth was only partially successful. However, a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre. A total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, with a seventh burn conducted on 30 November to insert MOM into a <a href=\"/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit\" title=\"Heliocentric orbit\">heliocentric</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Mars_transfer_orbit\" title=\"Mars transfer orbit\" class=\"mw-redirect\">orbit</a> for its transit to Mars.</p>\n\n<p>The first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 November 2013 at 19:47<span> </span>UTC when the spacecraft's <span>440-newton (99</span><span> </span><span>lb</span><sub about=\"#mwt400\">f</sub><span>)</span> <a href=\"/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket\" title=\"Liquid-propellant rocket\">liquid</a> engine was fired for 416 seconds.

When testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system, the flow to the liquid engine stopped, with consequent reduction in incremental velocity. During the fourth orbit burn, the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested. When both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes, the flow to the liquid engine stopped. Operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations, however they could be operated independently of each other, in sequence.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short, an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 November 2013 that increased the apogee to <span>118,642</span><span> </span><span>km (73,721</span><span> </span><span>mi)</span>, a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre.
